Characters can be sorted by:

- Newest

Or use the search to find a specific character by name or description.

## Character Profile

In the catalog, a character’s card displays brief information: the author’s username, the character’s name, description, number of chats, and rating.

To view full details, go to the character’s profile by clicking on their card.

In the character profile, you can read the full description, see greeting options that start chats, learn about the character’s personality, view the storyline, and read the author’s note. You can also rate the character, add them to favorites, share with friends, report them, or block the author.

If the character is available in multiple languages, you can select your preferred language in the top-right corner.

To see all characters created by the same author, click on their username.

## Favorites

To keep track of your favorite characters, add them to `Favorites`. Click the heart icon in the top-right corner of a character’s card. You can also do this on the character’s profile page or within a chat.

To view all your favorite characters, go to the `Favorites` section, which is located in the site’s left-hand menu.

## Sharing Characters

You can share an interesting character with friends via messaging apps or social networks. To do this, click the three dots in the top-right corner of the character’s card and select `Share` from the menu.

You can then choose one of the suggested messaging apps or copy the link to send it through any app or website.

## Report a Character

If you find a character that you believe violates community guidelines, report it to us. To do this, click the three dots in the top-right corner of the character’s card and select `Report` from the menu. In the window that appears, check the items the character may be violating and, if desired, fill in the `Additional details` field.

Moderators will review your report and take appropriate action.

## Blocking Authors

If you block an author, their characters will be hidden from the catalog and your favorites. To do this, click the three dots in the top-right corner of a character’s card, select `Block creator` from the menu, and confirm the action in the popup window.

To unblock an author, go to the `Blocked Creators` section in the site’s left-hand menu and click `Unblock` next to the desired author.

You can also block or unblock an author on their public profile page.
