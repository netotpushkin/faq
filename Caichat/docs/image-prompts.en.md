# Image Prompts

CAICHAT.AI uses Stable Diffusion to generate images from text. Detailed and specific prompts yield better results. Your words guide the creation process, and the AI brings them to life visually.

## How to Create Better Image Prompts

For high-quality image generation in Stable Diffusion, it’s important to provide clear and detailed prompts. Describe the object’s appearance, environment, and the scene’s atmosphere—the more precise the description, the more accurately the AI will capture your idea.

- Vivid Descriptions: Use specific details instead of general terms. For example, instead of “person,” specify gender, age, hairstyle, clothing, and distinguishing features.
- Environment and Atmosphere: Describe the background or setting, such as “sunny beach” or “dimly lit cozy room.”
- Mood and Tone: Convey the emotional tone, e.g., “calm and serene” or “dynamic and energetic.”
- Creativity: Be imaginative, but make the description visually understandable. Abstract ideas require concrete visual elements for accurate results.

## Composition and Perspective

Specify how elements should be arranged in the image and which object should be the focal point. Indicate the perspective: close-up, bird’s-eye view, or wide angle. These parameters set the overall mood and impression of the image.

## Comparative References

Include artistic or cinematic references to define the visual style. Mentioning artists or popular cultural imagery helps the generator better realize your concept.

## Review and Refine

Check your prompt before submitting to ensure it clearly reflects the intended image. If the result is unsatisfactory, refine the prompt with more detailed descriptions.
