# Tokens

Tokens break text into blocks for reading messages, displaying characters, and generating responses. Every input you provide and every character's response uses tokens.

The number of tokens you have access to depends on the AI model you are using and your subscription tier.

The available number of tokens depends on the selected AI model and your subscription level.

## How Tokens Affect Responses

Characters use tokens to form responses to your messages. The more tokens available, the longer and more detailed their responses can be. If the limit is exceeded, the response will be truncated.

Every word, part of a word, character, and emoji counts as a token. With a limited token budget, the character will respond more briefly and simply. In long conversations, characters may "forget" previous parts of the chat to stay within the limit.

The number of tokens per response depends on your settings and subscription level. You can change the token limit for characters in the generation settings.

## How Tokens Affect Character Creation

Keep an eye on your token budget when creating a character: the personality, scenario, greeting, and dialogue examples all use tokens. The number of tokens spent is displayed in the counter below the text field.

!!! note

	Use tokens efficiently: keep character descriptions concise, focus on key details, and summarize information to maintain clarity.

## How Tokens Affect Memory

Due to the token limit, a character can only remember a portion of the message history. With a small token budget, older messages may be forgotten, which affects their behavior in long dialogues.

Manage token usage when creating characters to ensure better consistency in their behavior.
